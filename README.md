Hi, 

Im trying to do the odin project, Recipe in this case. 

The outcome: 
My own repo for recipe, with 

a initial structure, recipe page, recipe page content. 

I expect myself to: 

utilize html, body, paragraphs, unlisted or list points, maybe some html image links, able to separate links based on different folders, bolding and emphasize at the basic level.
