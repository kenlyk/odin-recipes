    <h4> Above shows picture of a freshly made lasagna.</h4>
    <p> The Italian favorite of lasagne or lasagna that we all know and love <strong> originated in Italy in the city of Naples during the Middle Ages</strong>. </p> 
    <p> One of the first references to modern-day lasagne can be found in a 14th-century English cookbook that highlighted a dish with <em>layers of
        pasta without the tomatoes. </em> </p>

    <h3> Making a lasagna, below are the things you will need:</h3>

    <ul> 
        <li> ½ cup water </li>    
        <li> 2 tablespoons white sugar </li>   
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves </li> 
        <li> ½ teaspoon fennel seeds </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning </li> 
        <li> 1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li> 
        <li> 4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley </li>
        <li> 12 lasagna noodles </li>
        <li> 16 ounces ricotta cheese </li> 
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> ¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced </li>
        <li> ¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
    </ul>
<h3> Instructions to make the lasagna! As per below: </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil,
            fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold 
            water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one
             half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and 
             sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
             either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>
        <li> Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

    </ol>
